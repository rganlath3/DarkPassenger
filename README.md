<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The idea was to reuse a cheap roomba to create a platform for learning ROS and sensor integration. The end goal is to have a project incorporate aluminum extrusion, working with acrylic, ESP32-S3, stepper motors, thermal camera, depth camera, LIDAR, slip rings, DC motor controllers, encoders, 3D printing, INS sensor fusion, relays, GPS, and power distribution.
